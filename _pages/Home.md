Iâ€™m currently a final year Undergraduate Student majoring in Automation at <a href='https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/'>Zhejiang University (ZJU)</a>. I am also a research internship student at <a href='https://www.uchicago.edu/'>University of Chicago (UChi)</a>, Secure Learning Lab advised by Professor <a href=' https://aisecure.github.io/'> Bo Li</a>. Before that, I was also a research student at <a href='https://www.usslab.org/'> USSLAB</a> advised by Professor <a href='https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0020875'>Yanjiao Chen</a> and Professor <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/xiaoyuijh/home'> Xiaoyu Ji</a>.

Besides that, I am also a member of <a href='http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/2022/0225/c44633a2500643/page.htm'>Intensive Training Honors Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (ITP)</a> at <a href='http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/'>Chu Kochen Honors College</a>.

My current research primarily concentrates on **Trustworthy Machine Learning**, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the safety and robustness of advanced models. My research centers on exploring the vulnerability of cutting-edge ML models, especially **Multi-modal Models** (Text-to-Image model, VLM, Audio LLM etc.) and developing reliable defense mechanisms to safeguard their widespread deployments. By tackling these challenges, I aim to contribute to the development of AI technologies that are not only high-performing but also **secure, transparent, and aligned with ethical standards**.
