Here are things other than scientific research


## Personal Interests

I love musicðŸŽ¶, especially different kinds of independent music (Rock, R&B and so on). I also love to play keyboard/pianoðŸŽ¹ and I used to play keyboards in a band on campus.

I won't miss live performances by my favorite musicians. I believe watching music live is the best way to enjoy music.

I enjoy watching films & episodes at my free time.


## Notes During My Undergraduate Studies

Taking online notes on Notion is one of my habbits during my undergraduate studies. I arrange my notes (Chinese) in this <a href="https://skillful-vest-b8d.notion.site/Courses-in-ZJU-075c751a53964946814bcd0541c75d32">notion page</a>.
